# 5) **Putting it All Together**:
#        * Write a playbook named _setup-web.yml_ that:
#            * Uses the _web-servers.ini_ inventory.
#            * Applies the _nginx_setup_ role to both servers.
#            * Ensures that after execution, visiting the IP address of the servers on a browser shows the web page content defined in your variable.
